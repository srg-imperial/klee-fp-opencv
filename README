Building OpenCV LLVM Bitcode Library and these test benchmarks
==============================================================

1. Extract OpenCV 2.1.0
2. Apply the patch OpenCV-2.1.0-*.patch 
3. Create and cd to the build directory (sibling of OpenCV-2.1.0)
4. Edit the paths in OpenCV-2.1.0-build-llvm.sourceme and source it
5. make (it will build the libraries but errors out when building an executable, we don't care about the executable)
6. In this directory, edit paths in Makefile and make
7. klee -libc=klee eigenval.exe.bc
