Building OpenCV LLVM Bitcode Library and these test benchmarks
==============================================================

1. Copy the Makefile.config.sample file to a new file Makefile.config
   and insert paths for your machine.
   N.B. OPENCV_PATH and OPENCV_BUILD_PATH indicate paths where OpenCV
   will be extracted and built, not paths for an existing OpenCV

2. Type "make opencv" to build OpenCV to the provided build path
   (it will build the libraries but errors out when building an
   executable, we don't care about the executable)

3. Type "make" to build the benchmarks

4. To run a benchmark: klee -libc=klee eigenval.exe.bc
